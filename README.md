ParticleSwarmMinimiser
======================

Particle Swarm Optimisation Algorithm for finding the minimum of two functions.

The algorithm, and the two functions to be minimised are described here: http://thehomepageinternet.org/particleswarm.html

The code is written in Matlab. To run it, simply type PSO22a to minimise the first of the two described functions, or PSO22b to run the other one.
